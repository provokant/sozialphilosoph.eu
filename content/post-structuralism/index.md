Post-structuralism offers a way of studying how knowledge is produced and critiques structuralist premises. 
*It argues that because history and culture condition the study of underlying structures, both are subject to biases and misinterpretations.*
A post-structuralist approach argues that to understand an object (e.g., a text), it is necessary to study both the object itself and the systems of knowledge that produced the object.
